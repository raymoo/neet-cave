Uses NEET (https://github.com/raymoo/NEET)

# Installing

If you are using a release tied to some version of NEET, you can just run cabal install.
Otherwise, you may have to install NEET from repo too.

# Running

If you want it to go faster (use more cores), run it with ```neet-cave +RTS -N```.
The instructions are fairly self-explanatory. A good default for the number of
starting connections is 5 (I don't know if it really is, I have just been using
that).
